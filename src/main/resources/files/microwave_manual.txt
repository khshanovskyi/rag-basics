and dents inside the cavity or on the door. If there is any damage, do not operate the
oven and contact qualiﬁed service personnel.
3. This microwave oven must be placed on a ﬂat, stable surface to hold its weight and
the heaviest food likely to be cooked in the oven.
4. Do not place the oven where heat, moisture, or high humidity are generated, or near
combustible materials.
5. For correct operation, the oven must have sufﬁcient airﬂow. Allow minimum 20cm of
free space necessary above the top surface of the oven and 5cm at both sides. The
microwave oven rear plate must be placed close to the wall. Do not cover or block any
openings on the appliance. Do not remove feet.

GROUNDING INSTRUCTIONS
This appliance must be grounded. This oven is equipped with a cord having a grounding
wire with a grounding plug. It must be plugged into a wall receptacle that is properly
installed and grounded. In the event of an electrical short circuit, grounding reduces risk of
electric shock by providing an escape wire for the electric current. It is recommended that
a separate circuit, serving only the oven, be provided. Using a high voltage is dangerous
and may result in a ﬁre or other accident causing oven damage.
WARNING - Improper use of the grounding plug can result in a risk of electric shock.
Note:
1. If you have any questions about the grounding or electrical instructions, consult a
qualiﬁed electrician or service person.
2. Neither the manufacturer nor the dealer can accept any liability for damage to the
oven or personal injury resulting from failure to observe the electrical connection
procedures.
The wires in this cable mains are coloured in accordance with the following code:
Green and Yellow = EARTH
Blue = NEUTRAL
Brown = LIVE

RADIO INTERFERENCE
Operation of the microwave oven can cause interference to your radio, TV, or similar
equipment. When there is interference, it may be reduced or eliminated by taking the
following measures:
1. Clean door and sealing surface of the oven.
2. Reorient the receiving antenna of radio or television.
3. Relocate the microwave oven with respect to the receiver.
4. Move the microwave oven away from the receiver.
5. Plug the microwave oven into a different outlet so that microwave oven and receiver
are on different branch circuits.

BEFORE CALLING FOR SERVICE
Before asking for service, please check each item below:
Check to ensure the oven is plugged in securely. If not, remove the plug from the
outlet, wait 10 seconds, and plug it in again securely.
Check for a blown circuit fuse or a tripped main circuit breaker. If these seem to be
operating properly, test the outlet with another appliance.
7

Check to ensure the control panel is programmed correctly and the timer is set.
Check to ensure the door is securely closed, engaging the door lock system. If the
door is not properly closed, the microwave energy will not ﬂow inside.
IF NONE OF THE ABOVE RECTIFIES THE SITUATION, THEN CONTACT A QUALIFIED TECHNICIAN. DO NOT TRY TO ADJUST OR REPAIR THE OVEN YOURSELF.

COOKING TECHNIQUES
1. Arrange food carefully. Place thickest areas towards outside of dish.
2. Watch cooking time. Cook for the shortest amount of time indicated and add more as
needed. Foods severely overcooked can smoke or ignite.
3. Cover foods while cooking. Covers prevent spattering and help foods to cook evenly.
4. Turn foods over once during microwave cooking to speed cooking of such foods as
chicken and hamburgers. Large items like roasts must be turned over at least once.
5. Rearrange foods such as meatballs halfway through cooking both from top to bottom
and from the center of the dish to the outside.

COOKING UTENSILS GUIDE
1. Microwave cannot penetrate metal. Only use utensils that are suitable for use in
microwave ovens. Metallic containers for food and beverages are not allowed during
microwave cooking. This requirement is not applicable if the manufacturer speciﬁes
size and shape of metallic containers suitable for microwave cooking.
2. Microwave cannot penetrate metal, so metal utensils or dishes with metallic trim
should not be used.
3. Do not use recycled paper products when microwave cooking, as they may contain
small metal fragments which may cause sparks and/or ﬁres.
4. Round /Oval dishes rather than square/oblong ones are recommended, as food in
corners tends to overcook.
5. Narrow strips of aluminum foil may be used to prevent overcooking of exposed areas.
But be careful, don’t use too much and keep a distance of 1 inch (2.54cm) between
foil and cavity.
The list below is a general guide to help you select the correct utensils.

result at any rate not quite satisfactory,
please adjust the cooking time a little bit
accordingly.

CLEANING AND CARE
1. Turn off the oven and unplug the power cord from the wall when cleaning.
2. Keep the inside of the oven clean. When food splatters or spilled liquids adhere to
oven walls, wipe with a damp cloth. Mild detergents may be used if the oven gets very
dirty. Avoid using spray or other harsh cleaners. They may stain, streak or dull the
door surface.
3. The outside of the oven should be cleaned with a damp cloth. To prevent damage to
the operating parts inside the oven, water should not be allowed to seep into the
ventilation openings.
4. Wipe the door and window on both sides, the door seals and adjacent parts frequently
with a damp cloth to remove any spills or spatters. Do not use abrasive cleaner.
14

5. A steam cleaner is not be used.
6. Do not allow the control panel to become wet. Clean with a soft, damp cloth. When
cleaning the control panel, leave oven door open to prevent oven from accidentally
turning on.
7. If steam accumulates inside or around the outside of the oven door, wipe with a soft
cloth. This may occur when the microwave oven is operated under high humidity
condition. And it is normal.
8. It is occasionally necessary to remove the glass tray for cleaning. Wash the tray in
warm sudsy water or in a dishwasher.
9. The roller ring and oven ﬂoor should be cleaned regularly to avoid excessive noise.
Simply wipe the bottom surface of the oven with mild detergent. The roller ring may be
washed in mild, soapy water or in a dishwasher. When removing the roller ring, be
sure to replace it in the proper position.
10. Remove odors from your oven by combining a cup of water with the juice and skin of
one lemon in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave for 5 minutes. Wipe thoroughly and
dry with a soft cloth.
11. If the light bulb burns out, please contact customer service to have it replaced.
12. The oven should be cleaned regularly and any food deposits should be removed.
Failure to maintain the oven in a clean condition could lead to deterioration of surface
that could adversely affect the life of the unit and could possibly result in a hazardous
situation.
13. Please do not dispose of this appliance into the domestic rubbish bin; it should be
disposed to the particular disposal center provided by the municipalities.
14. When the microwave oven with grill function is ﬁrst used, it may produce slight smoke
and smell. This is a normal phenomenon, because the oven is made of a steel plate
coated with lubricating oil, and the new oven will produce fumes and odor generated
by burning the lubricating oil. This phenomenon will disappear after a period of using.
